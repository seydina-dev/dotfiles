## 🛠 Adding New Components
To add a new application to the toggle:
1. Create both dark and light versions of its configuration.
2. Update `~/.config/hypr/scripts/DarkLight.sh` to include the logic (usually a `ln -sf` or `sed`).
3. Add a reload command if the application doesn't pick up changes automatically.

## ⌨️ Help System
Press `SUPER + H` to generate and view a dynamic list of keybindings. This list is generated on-the-fly from `Keybinds.conf`.
To improve descriptions, add a `# Comment` at the end of your bind lines in `Keybinds.conf`.
